Weight Calculator

This is an app for calculating what weight needs to be loaded onto a bar for
lifting. As it is now it simply is a text box with a button, upon entering
a weight that is valid (A weight that is not a negative number, 0, divisible by 5, 
and actually the correct load in terms of plates) then the program will perform 
a recursive tallying of the load and display the exact amount of plates in plain
English that you would load upon one side.

Running the app
After installing all dependencies with "npm install" you can start the app locally
by running "npm start." This starts the app on "localhost:3000."
